# Adventure Game

*The latest in 1979 technology. Now in javascript!*

Want to "play" it? [Check it out over here](http://beep-bop-robot.com/game/adventuregame.html)

Currently just one level, but what a level it is! Featuring:

- *Movement!* Direction arrows will move your brave adventurer every which way!
- *Collision detection!* Just try to walk through that wall, you can't!
- *Interactive elements!* Step on a colored square, press the action button, and Poof! Something changed!

Much of this was written to toy with the edges of what you can do with a minimal toolset. All the walls are built using divs and interacting with the DOM. This absolutely should be rewritten using canvas, but what's the fun in that? 

Also, the current codebase is built with an eye towards modification. The goal is for "levels" to be nothing more than json.
